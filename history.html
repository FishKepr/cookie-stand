        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h2>A flash of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Our company was founded by a stay-at-home looking for a way to get those important omega-3 nutrients inter her family diet.  As she watched her ever moving children grab snacks off the kitchen counter and go, the idea for a treat suddenly hit her:  "Could I really do this?" She asked herself.  Her answer came in the form of a movie.</p>
        <h2>"Why Not?"</h2>
        <p>While watching the film "We Bought a Zoo", the tag line struck her.  "Why not?" So she gave it a try and Salmon Cookies were born.</p>
        <h2>Her Greatest fans (and Critics)</h2>
        <img src="images/family.jpeg" class="familyimage" alt="Family Photo">
        <p>As she perfected the recipies, her family performed the taste testing.  Naturally, she created a few failures (to put it politely), but they never stopped encouraging her to keep trying.  Eventually she hit on the right combination and unveiled Salmon Cookies to the world.</p>
